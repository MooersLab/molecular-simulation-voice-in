# Library of voice-triggered code snippets for molecular simulation using Voice-In Plus (coming soon)

Molecular simulation is an enormous domain with many acronyms.
The field spans from quantum chemistry through density functional theory to molecular dynamics simulations and up to probabilistic methods including the use of large language models.
Many spend an entire career in just one of these niches.
I will develop a separate library for drug discovery, which includes structure-based drug design.
The latter topic includes many aspects of molecular simulation but combining these two topics would be overwhelming.

This is a library of expansions of acronyms to help with the accurate expansion into the full terms.
