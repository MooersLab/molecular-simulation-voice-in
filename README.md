# Library of voice-triggered code snippets for molecular simulation using Voice-In Plus (coming soon)

Molecular simulation is an enormous domain with many acronyms.
The field spans quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics simulations, and even probabilistic methods, including the use of large language models.
Many spend an entire career in just one of these niches.

I will develop a separate drug discovery library, including structure-based drug design.
The latter topic includes many aspects of molecular simulation but combining these two topics would be overwhelming.

This library contains expansions of acronyms to ensure the accuracy of expansion since one's memory can be imperfect.
